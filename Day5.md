# Testing
>### What is Testing ?
<p align="justify">
Software testing is evaluating and verifying that software does it supposed to do. Testing can vary from validating few lines of code to verifying a full-fledged system feature.
</p>

>### Why we need Testing ?
<p align="justify">
The most important reason to have a test suit is that people write software. And people make mistakes. These mistakes can be costly if not detected and fixed early. With tests, we have proof that the system works as we intended.
</p>

>### Types of Testing
- Unit Testing
- Integration test

>### Unit Testing
<p align="justify">
Unit testing is a level of software testing where individual units or components of source code, such as functions or methods, are tested to determine if they work correctly.
</p>

>### Integration Testing
<p align="justify">
Integration testing is a level of software testing where individual units or components of source code, such as functions or methods, are combined and tested to determine if they work together correctly.
</p>

>### TDD Workflow
<p align="justify">
Test Driven Development (TDD) reverses the traditional development and testing. Usually we write the code first then after we write the test cases which is used to verify the features is working properly or note in the written code. But in TDD we wil write test cases first and then we write the code until it passes the test cases.

__TDD is a cyclic process of (RED-GREEN-BLUE)__

1. **RED Stage :**
    
    - Write a test case.
    - Run the test case and it fails (RED).

2. **GREEN Stage :**

    - Write a test case.
    - It shows that functionality already satisfied.

3. **BLUE Stage :**

    - Developer can modify the existing code without changing the behaviour.
    - This is also known as <i>Refactoring</i>
