        <li>Relational databases (e.g. MySQL, PostgreSQL)</li>
        <li>NoSQL databases (e.g. MongoDB, Cassandra)</li>
        <li>Graph databases (e.g. Neo4j)</li>
    </ul>
</p>

### Relational Database
<p align="justify">
A relational database is a system that stores and organizes data in tables, or "relations", in a way that makes it easy to see how different data points relate to each other</p>

### NoSQL Database
<p align="justify">
A NoSQL database is a system that stores and organizes data in a way that is different from traditional relational databases. NoSQL databases are designed to handle large amounts of unstructured or semi-structured
data and are often used in big data and real-time web applications.</p>

### Graph Database

A graph database is a system that stores and organizes data as a collection of nodes and edges, where each node represents an entity and each edge represents a relationship between entities.</p>
